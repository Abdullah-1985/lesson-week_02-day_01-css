    <h1>Experience</h1>
    <p>I recently graduated from a Front-End Web Development course at
         General Assembly where I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery 
         and how to be an awesome Front-End Web Developer! During my spare
          time, I enjoy senior water aerobics, pickling, and spending time with my
           goldfish, Jerry.</p>
